# Entry 3
duringt this week i was doing my research because i wanted more info on how to make shapes, and when i looked up in youtube i came across this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emFMHH2Bfvo which expalain what svg is. And i found this video very healpful because it put good details on svg.

I was trying to play around with snap.svg in other java script websites. But when i tired to put in the code. The console didn't respond so what i did is look up online and see why my code isn't working.When i dig around see why didn't worked. pasted the solution on the javascript. And when i run it again it worked for the first time.

my take aways from this week is the amount of issuse i have to come across.

the code the video put in:
<svg viewBox ="0, 0 100 100">

 <rect
class ="ansome-square "
  x="10" y="10"
  width="20%" height = "20"
   fill="red" storke="blue"
 >
and this code will come out as a red square
