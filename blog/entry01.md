introduction- Hello ithis year freedom project i'm learnign how to do javascpit. And my main tool for this year is https://snapsvg.io/demos/#globe. And why did i chose this? and what is my project idea?Well i chose this tool because i thouoght it's a great tool for a small simulator and i found it very interesting.And my project idea for this year is cars.I chose this project idea because i think cars are somthing that is interesting to work on and also i'm passionate about cars.And my idea for car project is either making a car enigie or making a small car simulator which the car could move.And one of my goals for this freedom project is understanding my tool and working with my tool. And i will use outside informotion on cars so i could put more stuff on my code.First i will look at car webistes and also i will look up at more at snapsvg information.And during those process i will make car noises or make a little model of a car. And one those skills that i will put into the car is understanding how much is a horsepower, because without horsepower the car could not move,And an other thing is how many cylinder it will be used on the car.
