# Entry 2
During the past few days i found some documents that could help me to create code for snap svg.And when i used this code to use in javascrpit snadbox,but the issuse with the code it's won't respond because it didn't had a link or something that help bulid a code,So i went oline to look at links that could help make the code to work. And i found a link that could help me to bulid or mod the code.And after i put on the code it now it runs good all because of the code.Now i have just needed to play around with this code and then i will make a smal car model or make a wheel


heres the code i found
<script src="snap.svg-min.js"></script>

var s = Snap("#svgout");


var r = s.rect(100,100,100,100,20,20).attr({ stroke: '#123456', 'strokeWidth': 20, fill: 'red', 'opacity': 0.2 });

var t = s.text(100,50,'Snap("#svg")

and this is the code that mod

var s = Snap("#svgout")

var r = s.rect(100,100,100,100,20,20).attr({ stroke: '#123456', 'strokeWidth': 20, fill: 'green'});
