# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **X**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

And for my year long project i will be making car models or car engine. And thorugh this process i will be learning more on javascrpit and also take a deep dive on cars.
